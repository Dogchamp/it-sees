### Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection ###

In order to correctly align the color channels, we first assign the correct color channel to each plate by dividing the image into vertical thirds, and then assigning the red color channel to the top third, the green color channel to the second third, and the blue color channel to the bottom third.
As an extra feature, we then automatically correct the contrast of the entire picture via CLAHE. openCV's CLAHE module prefers to operate on grayscale pictures, so this part is done pre-alignment.

Alignment is done by first finding the transformations that must be applied to each channel in order to be 
properly aligned. This is done by gradient matching. The transformation matrices are found using 
findTransformationECC(), and are applied via an affine transformation.

			
The images are then stacked on top of each other to form the final image.
