### Adversarial Networks
The goal of this project was to generate adversarial examples that could trick a networked pretrained to recognize
digits from the MNIST dataset.

In this example, we will be producing a 5, and try to get the network to think what we're giving it is an 8.
First we start with a randomly produced static image, and then calculate its gradient descent.
Then, we move opposite the gradient. We do this iteratively for a set amount of steps.
![Lined Up]({{ "/assets/project4/all lined up cropped.png" | absolute_url}})

Here is the output of the network. As we can see, the network thinks our adversarial 5 is an 8.
