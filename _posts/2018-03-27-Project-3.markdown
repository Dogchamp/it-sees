### Autostereograms ###
Tohe goal of the project is to make an autostereogram given a depth map and texture. 

The make_autostereogram() function will colors pixels with a corresponding pixel in the texture, 
skipping pixels by a displacement related to the depth found in the depth map, and wrapping around the row as 
needed until the entire row is colored, and this is done for every row.

Another autostereogram is made, but with smaller displacements, and this is overlayed on top of the first as a transparent layer, 
in order to produce a greater sense of depth.

An example of a color texture used:
![Texture]({{ "/assets/texture.jpg" | absolute_url}})

![Depth Map]({{ "/assets/shark-dm.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:height="50%" width="50%"} ![Autostereogram]({{ "/assets/shark-dm-sgram.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:height="50%" width="50%"}

![ASgram With Overlay]({{ "/assets/shark-dm-sgram-with-overlay.jpg" | absolute_url}}){:height="50%" width="50%"}

![Depth_Map]({{ "/assets/depth.jpg" | absolute_url }}) ![Autostereogram]({{ "/assets/depth-sgram.jpg" | absolute_url }})
